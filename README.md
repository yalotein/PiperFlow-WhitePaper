> *Piper* is a nickname for "Pipelines" - *Flow* means the smooth process  
> **PiperFlow**: Turning drug discovery pipelines into transparent, community-driven workflows

## Overview

PiperFlow is a decentralized blockchain-based platform designed to revolutionize drug discovery and development through transparent, immutable milestone recording, community validation, and IP-NFT royalty sharing. Built on the Solana blockchain, PiperFlow creates an auditable record-keeping system for the entire drug development pipeline.

## The Vision

Drug discovery pipelines are complex, multi-year processes involving countless decisions and experiments. PiperFlow makes these pipelines flow smoothly by:

- Creating **immutable records** of every milestone
- Enabling **community validation** of research data
- Sharing **future revenues** with contributors through IP-NFTs
- Building a **global marketplace** for scientific expertise
- Ensuring **regulatory compliance** from day one

## Key Features

### üî¨ Immutable Milestone Recording
Record every critical decision and data point on the Solana blockchain with cryptographic links to detailed off-chain data. Your pipeline's history is permanently preserved and verifiable.

### ‚úÖ Community Validation System
Stake-based validation with challenge and defense mechanisms to ensure data integrity and scientific rigor. The community keeps your pipeline honest.

### üí∞ IP-NFT Royalty Sharing
Biotech companies can share 10-20% of future revenues with community contributors through fractional IP-NFT ownership. Align incentives and access global talent without upfront costs.

### üåê Global Talent Marketplace
Decentralized marketplace for outsourcing research tasks, validation, and expert consultation. Find the right expertise for each stage of your pipeline.

### üèõÔ∏è DAO Governance
Community-driven governance for protocol upgrades, fee structures, and dispute resolution. PiperFlow evolves with its users.

### üìä Regulatory Ready
Designed for compliance with FDA, EMA, GDPR, and HIPAA requirements. Your pipeline data is audit-ready from the start.

## Participation Models

PiperFlow supports biotech companies at any stage of their pipeline:

### Early-Stage Pipeline (Idea/Target Only)
- Start from Milestone 0 with just a hypothesis
- Crowdsource validation and development work
- Mint IP-NFT (15-20% revenue share) to attract top talent
- Build transparent track record for investors

### Advanced-Stage Pipeline (Preclinical Candidate)
- Batch upload historical milestones
- Create auditable trail for regulatory submissions
- Mint IP-NFT (10-15% tiered) for partnership trust
- Streamline due diligence for licensing deals

## IP-NFT Royalty Sharing

One of PiperFlow's most innovative features is the ability for project initiators to share future revenues with the community:

- **Fractional Ownership:** Companies mint IP-NFTs representing 10-20% of future revenues
- **Automatic Distribution:** Smart contracts distribute royalties to contributors proportionally
- **Multiple Models:** Fixed percentage, tiered milestones, capped royalty, or hybrid
- **Revenue Events:** Licensing deals, milestone payments, sales royalties, acquisitions
- **Secondary Market:** IP-NFT shares are tradeable for liquidity

**Example:** A $50M licensing deal with 15% community share distributes $7.5M to IP-NFT holders, plus ongoing royalties.

## Technology Stack

- **Blockchain:** Solana (high throughput, low cost)
- **Smart Contracts:** Rust-based programs
- **Off-Chain Storage:** IPFS / Arweave
- **Identity:** Decentralized identity with KYC/AML
- **Frontend:** React-based web application
- **Oracles:** Chainlink for external data verification

## Roadmap

### Phase 1: MVP Development (Months 1-6)
- Core smart contracts
- Milestone recording and validation
- Basic marketplace

### Phase 2: Community Building (Months 7-12)
- Token launch and distribution
- IP-NFT implementation
- DAO governance activation

### Phase 3: Ecosystem Growth (Months 13-24)
- Disease-specific subgroups
- Regulatory partnerships
- Integration with CROs and academic labs

### Phase 4: Scaling and Adoption (Months 25+)
- Cross-chain interoperability
- Advanced analytics and AI
- Global expansion
